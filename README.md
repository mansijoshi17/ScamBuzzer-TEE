# Description: 
ScamBuzzer is a privacy-first platform that analyses users' emails, social interactions, and crypto transactions to detect and prevent scams without compromising data privacy, powered by TEE and Nillion's Blind Computation.

# Key Features of ScamBuzzer:
🛡️ Wallet Risk Scoring: Detects drainer smart contracts and verifies the authenticity of URLs.
📩 Private DM/Email Scam Detection: Uses Nillion-powered LLM to scan content and prevent scams without ever exposing users’ data.
🔒 Address Poisoning Protection: Securely bookmarks trusted wallet addresses with Nillion’s secret vault to block copy-paste scams and prevent any malware from altering addresses.
🕵️‍♂️ Anonymous Scam Reporting: A blind, community contribution to report phishing links and wallet drainers fully anonymously. 

## How its made: 
We built a Chrome extension and web app using the tech stack: TypeScript, Node.js, Secret Vault, TEE, and Blind Computation by Nillion.

# Integration details:
  1)  Nillion’s Secret LLM is used to analyse users' emails and social interactions to alert them of crypto scam attempts without compromising their privacy. 
  2) Nillion’s Secret Vault securely stores bookmarked crypto addresses to prevent address poisoning scams. 
  3) Nillion’s database stores flagged scam contract addresses and phishing links for wallet risk scoring.
**Nillion completely abstracted the complexity of TEE, cryptography, and LLM, which made it easier for us to build.**
